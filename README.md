# CS351 Project 3
## Donkey Kong Jr.

## Description
DonkeyKongJr.java is the main class of this program and launches a window with the instructions and the 
game window.
This is a recreation of the first level of Donkey Kong Jr. along with another level from the official game but set up with a different goal in mind.
This uses a majority of the sprite animations and sprite work
used in the NES version of the game, as the arcade version does not have available sprites.

## Usage
Upon starting the program the instructions below are given in an additional window, this lays out the controls and 
the goals for each game mode.

    Instructions
    Jump to grab onto vines/chains, Junior climbs up very slow on one vine/chain but by reaching for
    another he climbs much faster, however holding onto only one vine/chain makes sliding down faster.

    Game Modes
    Game A: The first level of Donkey Kong Jr. Make it to the blue key at the top of the level as fast
    as possible, avoid enemies, collect fruit, and drop fruit onto enemies for a higher score! Don't let
    Junior fall too far or you'll lose a life!

    Game B: A custom level for this project, Junior only has one life, fruit respawns, and enemies spawn
    faster as the game progresses. Survive as long as possible, collect fruit, and drop that fruit on
    enemies to get a high score before the enemies overwhelm Junior!

    Controls
    Left/Right: Move right and left on the ground, or reach/grab a vine/chain
    Up/Down: Climb up and down the vines/chains, or change selection on title screen
    Space: Jump
    Enter: Start the game with the highlighted selection on title screen
